Moftes Traveller Tools
======================
These are some simple tools for use with the 1st Edition of the Pen & Paper Tabletop RPG "Traveller" by Mongoose. 
Right now all tools are in German.

## UWP Translator
This is a simple UWP Translator, that transforms the standardized code into text. 
UWP stands for Universal World Profile, for more information look here: https://wiki.travellerrpg.com/Universal_World_Profile
This script supports entering the name and then either a complete UWP (e.g. A325B93-E) or the eight codes one after another or random world generation.

## NPC Generator
The NPC generator let's you enter a name for the NPC and then displays the six attributes, five randomly choosen skills, one melee and one ranged weapon.
